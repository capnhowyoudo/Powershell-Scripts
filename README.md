# ⚠️ Use At Your Own Risk — PowerShell Scripts

Supported PowerShell: PowerShell 5.1 / PowerShell 7+ (specify whichever applies)

# ⚠️ High-level disclaimer

These PowerShell scripts are provided as-is, without warranty of any kind. By running or using these scripts you accept full responsibility for any consequences — including data loss, system instability, security issues, or legal/regulatory impacts. Do not run these scripts on production systems unless you understand every line and have tested them in a safe environment.

Recommended precautions (must-read)

Test in a sandbox or VM first (e.g., a disposable virtual machine or container).

Back up important data before running anything that modifies files, system settings, the registry, or user accounts.

Review the entire script line-by-line. Do not run blindly.

Run with least privilege — only elevate to Administrator when absolutely necessary.

Use -WhatIf / -Confirm switches in cmdlets that support them while testing.

Use Get-ExecutionPolicy -List to check system policies and avoid changing global policies permanently.

Prefer signed scripts — consider signing with an Authenticode certificate for production use.

Use source control (Git) and code review for changes to the script.

WARNING: Use at your own risk. Review code. Test in VM.

## Requirements
- PowerShell 7+ or Windows PowerShell 5.1
- Admin privileges (only if required by the script actions)
